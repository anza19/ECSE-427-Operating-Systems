Hello to anyone reading the README.txt.
It contains instructions on how to compile and run my code for the second assignment for ECSE 427.

There are 9 files of interest:

1) a2_lib.c
2) a2_lib.h
3) comp310_a2_test1.c
4) comp310_a2_test2.c
5) comp310_a2_test.h
6) config.h
7) read_eval.c
8) read_eval.h
9) Makefile (this was provided to us by the TAs)

The file a2_lib.c contains contains the actual source code for the assignment, with the file a2_lib.h header
having the function declarations.

To run the the first test, simply run the following command in the shell:
1) make test1
2) ./os_test1

This uses the make tool for the Makefile provided to us by the TAs

To run the second test simply do the following:
1) make test2
2) ./os_test2

-Thanks
Anza
